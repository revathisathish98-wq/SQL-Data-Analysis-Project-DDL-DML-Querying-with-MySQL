# SQL-Data-Analysis-Project-DDL-DML-Querying-with-MySQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on experience with **MySQL** by implementing core **SQL concepts** such as database creation, table design, constraints, and data querying.  
It focuses on writing clean, optimized SQL queries to manage and analyze structured data effectively.

This repository is designed to showcase **SQL fundamentals** for beginners and aspiring **Data Analysts / Database Developers**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and apply **DDL (Data Definition Language)** commands  
- Work with **constraints** to ensure data integrity  
- Perform **DML operations** such as inserting, updating, and deleting records  
- Write efficient **SQL queries** for data retrieval and analysis  
- Gain practical exposure to real-world SQL scenarios  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **self-created** using SQL scripts.  
It simulates real-world entities such as:
- Users / Employees / Students  
- Departments / Courses  
- Transactions / Records  

All tables and data are generated using **MySQL DDL and DML commands**.

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Database and table creation using `CREATE DATABASE` and `CREATE TABLE`
- Applying constraints:
  - `PRIMARY KEY`
  - `FOREIGN KEY`
  - `UNIQUE`
  - `NOT NULL`
  - `CHECK`
  - `DEFAULT`
- Data manipulation using:
  - `INSERT`
  - `UPDATE`
  - `DELETE`
- Data querying using:
  - `SELECT`
  - `WHERE`
  - `ORDER BY`
  - `GROUP BY`
  - `HAVING`
  - `JOINS`
  - Subqueries

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Proper use of constraints improves **data accuracy and consistency**
- Well-structured tables simplify complex queries
- Joins help extract meaningful insights from multiple tables
- SQL queries can efficiently handle large datasets when optimized
